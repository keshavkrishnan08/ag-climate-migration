"""Phase 5C: Hedonic farmland valuation with soil productivity controls.

Reviewer concern: the baseline hedonic (06b) uses climate + socioeconomic
controls but no soil quality control. Omitting soil quality may bias the
climate coefficient if soil quality correlates with both temperature and land
values (e.g., rich soils in the Corn Belt → high values AND moderate temps).
