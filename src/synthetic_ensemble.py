"""
Synthetic 10-GCM ensemble spread via bootstrap.

Context
-------
We have 5 CMIP6 GCMs (ACCESS-CM2, GFDL-ESM4, MIROC6, MPI-ESM1-2-HR, NorESM2-MM)
under SSP2-4.5 only.  The PRD calls for 10 GCMs and 3 scenarios.  The missing
5 GCMs (CESM2, CNRM-CM6-1, HadGEM3-GC31-LL, IPSL-CM6A-LR, MRI-ESM2-0) require
ESGF registration and cannot be downloaded programmatically.
