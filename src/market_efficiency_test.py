Market Efficiency Test for Climate Risk Pricing in Farmland Values.

Tests whether farmland markets are already capitalizing projected climate risk.
If efficient, counties with larger projected warming (delta_tmax_july 2040)
should show LOWER recent land-value appreciation.

Regression:
    Δlog(land_value)_{2012-2022} = α + β₁·delta_tmax_july_2040
                                    + β₂·Δlog(income) + β₃·Δlog(pop)
