"""Revision script: stranded farmland DCF recomputation with defensible real prices.

Responds to Reviewer 1, Major #1:
  (a) Uses 30-yr (1994-2023) inflation-adjusted marketing-year average prices
      instead of near-peak nominal prices. Prices held flat in real terms —
      consistent with USDA long-run price outlook (USDA 2024a).
  (b) Adds alternate-use floor: per-acre losses capped at
      (cropland value - pasture/grazing land value) where cropping returns
      go negative.
