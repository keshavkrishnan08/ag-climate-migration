"""Substantive experiments addressing the critique.

E1. Insurance falsification: process-based Schlenker-Roberts yield path (independent of ML)
E2. Insurance climate-dependent sigma: variance scales with projected temperature
E3. Migration metro placebo: clean falsification on metro-only counties
E4. Migration effect-size dominance: farm-dep beta / non-farm beta ratio
E6. Depopulation NATIONAL welfare floor: search-frictional cost only
E8. Stranded ML vs process explicit decomposition
E9. Stranded DCF without INDIRECT_MULTIPLIER (pure direct)
